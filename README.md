# heatmaps
a simple example of how to do heat maps without the use of the internet.

why without the use of internet? imagine you're in a super confidential environment
and you are not allowed to have your code connect to the other or the server you are
working in has internet access completely disabled.

the premise is that you have a company that makes sense in virginia through two divisions
your goal is to find out the zip codes where the absolute difference between the two 
divisions' sales are the greatest. 

please note that the shapefile data for this are from the united state census
i do not own or claim ownership of the data by any means except for the sales and location excel data
the sales and location data are created randomly in excel

the us census shapefile data can be found at this link:
