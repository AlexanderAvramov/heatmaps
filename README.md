# heatmaps
a simple example of how to do heat maps without the use of the internet.

why without the use of the internet? imagine you're in a super confidential environment
and you are not allowed to have your code connect to the internet or the server you are
working in has the internet access completely disabled.

the premise is that you have a company that makes sales in virginia through two divisions.
your goal is to find out the zip codes where the absolute difference between the two 
divisions' sales are the greatest and to visualize that.

disclaimer: please note that the shapefile data are from the united state census.
i do not own or claim ownership of the data by any means.
the only data i created are the fake sales and location excel data.
the fake sales and location data are created randomly in excel.

the us census shapefile data can be found at this link:

prior to use their data, please check their restrictions and requirements.
