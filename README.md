# heatmaps
a simple example of how to do heat maps without the use of the internet.

why without the use of the internet? imagine you're in a super confidential environment
and you are not allowed to have your code connect to the internet or the server you are
working in has the internet access completely disabled.

ok, so what's the idea of these maps? well, the premise is that you have a company that makes sales 
in virginia through two divisions. your goal is to find out the zip codes where the absolute
difference between the two divisions' sales are the greatest and to visualize that.

disclaimer: please note that the shapefile data are from the united state census.
i do not own or claim ownership of the data by any means. i am not using the data
for commercial purposes. purely educational. 
the only data i created are the fake sales and location excel data.

the us census shapefile data can be found at this link:
https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html

please download the shapefile data and place them in the input folder, if you want the code to run.
i have specifically left the data out because of the size.

very important!!! prior to using the us census data, please check their restrictions and requirements.
