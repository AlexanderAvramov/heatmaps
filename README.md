# heatmaps
a simple example of how to do heat maps without the use of the internet:

the premise is that you have a company that makes sense in virginia through two divisions
your goal is to find out the zip codes where the absolute difference between the two 
divisions' sales are the greatest

please note that the shapefile data for this are from the united state census
i do not own or claim ownership of the data by any means except for the sales and location excel data
the sales and location data are created randomly in excel

the us census shapefile data can be found at this link:
